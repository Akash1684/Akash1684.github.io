I started coding when I was 10 years old, and havenâ€™t stopped since then. In my 4+ years technical career (all with Amazon), I have worked with plethora of cool technologies and still learning new things every single day, which ofcourse is also fueled by Amazon's fast growing software development and requirement to build software at scale.  

With lot of building and breaking stuff comes lot of experience and learnings. Though I capture and share those learnings through our internal blogs/docs and tech talks, I believe some of them will be helpful to the wider software community. So I am kick starting this external blog in an attempt to share my expereince and also learn from others'.
