Following are my research projects that I have done during summer internships and some additional projects that are carried out as course or hobbie project during semesters.  

### Key Research Projects

* [**Deadlock-free synchronization for GPU architecture**](https://akash1684.github.io//projects/){:target="_blank"} | June 2016, Present :
  <br>
  [*GPU Centre of Excellence(GCOE), IIT Bombay, India*](http://gcoe-iitb.in/){:target="_blank"} | Research Intern
  <br><br/>
  Presently, working towards development of a deadlock-free algorithm to synchronize threads for GPGPU applications on CUDA framework.     Proposed algorithm is inspired by Banker’s algorithm for resource allocation in CPU and is being tested on Delaunay Mesh Refinement     Benchmark.

* [**A MHP Analysis Framework for SPMD Model**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2jIT4Extjujc2F3bmNTSHh1NGs){:target="_blank"} | May 2016, June 2016 :
  <br>
  [*Advisor : Prof. R.K Shyamasundar (IIT Bombay, India)*](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=Q1hcun8AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"} | Summer Intern 
  <br><br/>
  Developed a framework for May-Happen-In-Parallel Analysis for Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) Model using Async and Finish           constructs. Framework takes X10 Program and two Statements as input and return Condition Vectors Set (CS) that defines whether the       statements can execute in parallel or not.

* [**A novel PSO algorithm for DWT-SVD Watermarking**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2jIT4ExtjujUFVRS0pJVW1rbHM/view?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} | May 2015, June 2015
  <br>
  [*Advisor : Prof. K.K Mishra (MNNIT Allahabad, India)*](http://www.mnnit.ac.in/old/index.php/departments/engineering/computer-science-and-engineering/faculty-profile/250-krishn-k-mishra-csed.html){:target="_blank"} | Summer Intern 
  <br><br/>
  In this project a novel particle swarm optimizer (PSO) variant is proposed and is compared with 5 well known PSO variants using CEC’13   benchmark function. Existing watermarking scheme for RGB image based on singular value decomposition (SVD) in DWT (Discrete wavelet     transformation) is further optimized using proposed PSO variant. Result: Reduction upto 33% in FES (Function Evaluations) for some       basic multimodal functions and 22% increase in fitness of the watermarking scheme compared to the conventional scheme.

### Course and Side Projects

* [**AKA-shell**](https://github.com/Akash1684/AKA-shell){:target="_blank"} : <br> A naive implementation of LINUX shell in C. It demonstrates how a shell works i.e. read, parse, fork, exec and wait. Built-in commands includes cd, help, exit, hist. Project was done as part of Operating System course, under Prof. J.P. Singh, NIT Patna.

* [**Timex- A chrome extension**](https://github.com/Akash1684/Timex){:target="_blank"} : <br> It keeps track of surfing time, when extension is accessed time spent along with random quote is displayed. Project was done as part of Web Technology course, under Prof. Kumar Abhishek, NIT Patna.

* [**Tweete (Twitter Handler)**](https://github.com/Akash1684/Tweete){:target="_blank"} : <br> Tweete is a desktop application designed in JAVA that provides interface to interact with Twitter account using Twitter4j API. Presently, Tweete have three features: Update Status, Send Direct Messages and Retrieve Previous Tweets.

* [**pyBuzz**](https://github.com/Akash1684/pyBuzz){:target="_blank"} : <br> A python script that sends weather forecast summary along with word of the day to mobile phone on system startup. Dependencies includes BeautifulSoup, Twilio, Urllib and Forecastio.

* [**Shut-it-Down**](https://github.com/Akash1684/Shut-it-Down){:target="_blank"} : <br> A desktop application that automates the scheduling of system shutdown (Windows Users). Designed using JAVA Swing and implemented using System Calls.

* [**File Encryption and Decryption using cipher class**](https://github.com/Akash1684/File_Encryptor){:target="_blank"} : <br> A console based Encryption and Decryption application developed in JAVA. This project was done during Summer Training at Hewlett-Packard (HP) nodal center, India, 2014.
