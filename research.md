My research interests primarily consist of : 

* **Parallel Computing** :
In the present world, the need of efficient and large computation is exponentially increasing but the hardware scaling is bounded by Moore's Law. Software based parallelism is very much desired in order to maximize hardware utilization. I have worked towards analyzing the parallelism possibility in X10 programs during my stint at IIT Bombay, India.

* **Swarm Intelligence** :
Ability to solve variations of complex problems under certain constraints have deepen my interest in the field of Swarm Intelligence and its applications, ranging from sensor networks to robotics. I explored the aspects of Swarm intelligence in field on Image processing during my internship at MNNIT Allahabad, India and immensely enjoyed the opportunity.

I have explored these areas through multiple <a href="https://akash1684.github.io//projects/" target="_blank">projects</a> and have found my interests in them.
