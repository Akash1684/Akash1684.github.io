My research interests primarily consist of : 

* **Parallel Computing** :
In the present world, the need of efficient and large computation is exponentially increasing but the hardware scaling is bounded by Moore's Law, Moore predicts that hardware is soon going to reach saturation. I firmly believe, given the present scenario this area will be playing a very critical role in coming generation. Software based parallelism is very much desired in order to maximize hardware utilization. I have worked towards analyzing the parallelism possibility in X10 programs during my stint at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India.

* **Swarm Intelligence** :
Ability to solve large variation of complex problems under certain constraints have deepen my interest in the field of Swarm Intelligence and its applications ranging from sensor networks to robotics. I believe Swarm Intelligence along with conventional algorithm will have great impact on problem solving techniques in future. I explored the aspects of Swarm intelligence in field on Image processing during my internship at MNNIT Allahabad, India and immensely enjoyed the opportunity.
I firmly believe that interplay of these two areas can solve many networking and optimization issues coming up with fast growth of complex real life problems.

I have explored these areas through multiple <a href="https://akash1684.github.io//projects/" target="_blank">projects</a> and have found my interests in them.
