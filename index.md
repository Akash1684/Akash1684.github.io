A graduate from the Department of Information Technology at the <a href="http://nitp.ac.in/php/home.php" target="_blank">National Institute of Technology, Patna (NIT Patna)</a> and presently working as **Software Development Engineer - II at Amazon India**, where my work primarily focuses on enabling VAT Services for sellers all across Europe. 

<br/>

I have a special liking towards open source development and related activity, as it promises to provide the opportunity to learn something new, and to contribute to my fullest capability.This is an attempt to portray myself in a very concise way.
